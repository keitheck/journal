##201 JOURNAL

###Monday 16th

-I seem to have lost the previous journal that I hope to recover from a git branch conflict, but until then am starting another repository for the purpose.  

-Today we started the "Bus-Mall" project that incorporates all that we have learned thus far.  I was able to quickly move through the planning and goal sheet for the day.  Creating the constructor function was quick and straight forward.  It took a few minutes to white board options for the image path list which I decided to use a for loop to search through the img directory to make an array.  After writing code that seemed like it should work I learned that javascript can only execute within its current directory for security reasons and needed to find another solution, which was hand writing an array for the purpose.

    The splicing script to build a name array from the image path array took some research but was easy enough.  However, when it came time to write the javascript to access and manipulate the DOM, I stuggled.  I need to find time to continue to learn the basics of this as it is very apparent that it is a gap in my knowledge base.
